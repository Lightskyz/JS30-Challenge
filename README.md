# JS30 Challenge

I decided to take the [JavaScript 30 Challenge by Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/). It'll be the first daily challenge that I'll commit for next days.

## Dependencies
To convert the pug and sass files to be converted into html and css files, install npm dependencies `npm install`
It will allow Gulp to work properly and launch a local static server `gulp serve`

## Content of this project
- Each challenge is developed with PugJS, SASS and Javascript
